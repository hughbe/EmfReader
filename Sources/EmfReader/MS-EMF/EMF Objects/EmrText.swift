/// The EmrText object contains values for text output.
/// If the Options field of the EmrText object contains the ETO_PDY flag, then this buffer contains twice as many values as there are
/// characters in the output string, one horizontal and one vertical offset for each, in that order.
/// If ETO_RTLREADING is specified, characters are laid right to left instead of left to right. No other options affect the interpretation of
/// this field.
/// The size and encoding of the characters in the OutputString is determined by the type of record that contains this object, as follows:
///  EMR_EXTTEXTOUTA (section 2.3.5.7) and EMR_POLYTEXTOUTA (section 2.3.5.32) records: 8-bit ASCII characters.
///  EMR_EXTTEXTOUTW (section 2.3.5.8) and EMR_POLYTEXTOUTW (section 2.3.5.33) records: 16- bit Unicode UTF16-LE characters.
